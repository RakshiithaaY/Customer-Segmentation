# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation and Churn analysis

1. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing prepares the dataset for analysis and modeling by:

Handling Missing Data: Impute or remove missing values.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical data (e.g., Gender, Region) to numeric format using One-Hot Encoding.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features to bring them to a similar scale.
Removing Irrelevant Features: Drop unnecessary columns like CustomerID or Cluster.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves summarizing the dataset to uncover patterns:
Summary Statistics: Check the mean, median, and distribution of numerical features.
Visualizations: Use histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize data distributions and relationships.
Correlation Matrix: Identify correlations between features to guide feature selection.

3. Segmentation Analysis
Segmentation groups customers based on similar characteristics:
Clustering: Use algorithms like K-Means to segment customers into clusters (e.g., high-income, high-spending groups).
Cluster Profiling: Analyze and profile each cluster to understand key customer traits.

4. Visualization
Visualization helps in understanding the data:
Histograms and Box Plots: Show the distribution and outliers.
Pair and Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between features.
Bar Plots: Compare categorical features or values across groups.

5. Predictive Analysis
Predictive analysis uses models to forecast future behaviors:
Modeling: Train models like Logistic Regression or Random Forest to predict outcomes (e.g., churn).
Evaluation Metrics: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters for better results.

6. Churn Analysis
Churn analysis predicts customers likely to stop interacting with the business:
Define Churn: Identify behaviors indicating churn (e.g., low spending).
Predictive Modeling: Use models to identify at-risk customers.
Retention Strategies: Target churn-prone customers with loyalty programs or discounts.
